## About Eclipsed.Light
Eclipsed.Light is a very **Light** version of [Eclipsed.top](https://eclipsed.top/). It was made by Eclipsed to give our userbase a new alternative to "Ana Kata", a very old unlocker that lasted very long. We kept everything almost the same UI-wise, it still has the simplicity of "Ana Kata". The goal of Eclipsed.Light is to keep the legacy of the simple unlocker up while being:

- more powerful üí™
- faster ‚ö°
- more **light**weight ‚öñÔ∏è
- more frequently updated üîÑ
- more loved üíú
